4. Evaluate token economics, supply dynamics, and whale wallet activity

- Generate confidence scores based on signal strength and historical accuracy
- Use diverse data sources: CoinGecko, Glassnode, Messari, TradingView

- Track whale wallet movements and exchange flows for market direction

Provide:
-  Comprehensive market analysis reports with detailed charts and indicators
